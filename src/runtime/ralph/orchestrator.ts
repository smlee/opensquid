/**
 * GR.4 — the gated-ralph orchestrator: a thin, non-LLM loop that composes GR.1–3.
 *
 * One pass: read the oldest ready item (GR.1 `listReady`) → atomically claim it (GR.1 CAS) → run a
 * supervised lap (GR.3 `superviseLap` over an injected lap-runner that wraps `claude -p RALPH.md` +
 * GR.2 `parseLapOutcome`) → act on the typed `LapOutcome` (GR.2) → repeat until BOARD_EMPTY or a
 * stopping escalation. No new state store (claim/wedge are work-graph ops); no new gate logic (the lap
 * is gated by the same coding-flow); ONE uniform escalation (GR.3 `escalateLap`).
 *
 * Dependencies are INJECTED (`RalphDeps`) so the loop is pure composition and unit-testable without the
 * notification stack or a real `claude` subprocess — the CLI (`ralph.ts`) wires the real store, the
 * `claude -p` lap-runner, and `escalateSeverity`.
 *
 * The S1 spike PROVED spawn-a-lap is safe (a nested `--dangerously-skip-permissions` lap's ungated
 * commit was blocked by the gate), so this loop spawns laps directly rather than via Alternative F.
