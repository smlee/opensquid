/**
 * Active-pack discovery — scan a scope root for `active.json` + `packs/<name>/`.
 *
 * G.1 wires the real loader path. Given a scope root (either user-scope from
 * `resolveUserScopeRoot()` or project-scope from `resolveProjectScopeRoot(cwd)`),
 * this module:
 *
 *   1. Reads `<scopeRoot>/active.json` — schema `{ packs: string[] }`.
 *   2. For each entry, loads `<scopeRoot>/packs/<name>/` through the
 *      existing `loadPack` (Phase-2 pack format: `manifest.yaml` + `skills/`).
 *
 * Behavior contract:
 *   - `scopeRoot === null`           → returns `[]` (project absent case).
 *   - `active.json` ENOENT           → returns `[]` (scope present, no opt-in).
 *   - `active.json` malformed JSON   → throws path-bearing error.
 *   - `active.json` missing `packs:` → throws with clear "missing field" message.
 *   - `active.json` references a pack folder that doesn't exist or fails to
 *     load → `loadPack` throws; we propagate verbatim.
 *
 * Fail-loud is intentional per `project_opensquid_runtime_failure_handling`
 * memory: a user-authored config bug must surface, not silent-fail to the
 * "allow everything" path. The two test seams in `bootstrap.ts`
 * (`OPENSQUID_TEST_PACK`, `OPENSQUID_TEST_PACK_DIR`) keep their own
 * fail-open contracts because their fixtures are opensquid-authored, not
 * user-authored.
 *
 * Harness-agnostic: this module knows nothing about Claude Code, hook
 * formats, or any consumer-side concept. The settings-writer that lives in
 * `src/setup/wizard/` is the ONLY G.1 module that names the consumer.
 *
 * Imports from: node:fs/promises, node:path, packs/loader.
 * Imported by: src/runtime/bootstrap.ts (the real loader path).
